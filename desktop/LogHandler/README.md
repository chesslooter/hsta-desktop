# Log File Configuration

For the game to store information you must configure the log files with a file of your own.
The file that must be added is log.config.
These are the places you must put the file if you want it to work. Currently there are some permission
issues with placing the file there automatically, so we can manually place the file according to the locations below.
In the future we may add an option that allows for users to set the location of the log file that is different from the default log file
location. 

## Windows
Create a log.config file in one of the two following folders:

C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Local\Blizzard\Hearthstone

%LOCALAPPDATA%/Blizzard/Hearthstone

## OS X
Create a log.config file in the folder ~/Library/Preferences/Blizzard/Hearthstone
